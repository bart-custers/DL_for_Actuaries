# DL_for_Actuaries

This repository aims to provide python code examples for three deep learning approaches that can be used by actuaries.

Actuaries typically use tabular datasets. Although neural networks and deep learning frameworks are among the most advanced AI models, they tend to be disadvantaged on tabular datasets. Moreover, deep learning frameworks are opaque and impossible to interpret.

The academic and actuarial community has focused on this issue and developed methodologies that aim to overcome these issues.

Three solutions will be shown in this repo:

* Combined Actuarial Neural Network (a hybrid form of GLM and neural network)
* LocalGLMNet (a hybrid form of GLM and neural network)
* TabNet (a neural network framework specifically aimed at tabular data)
